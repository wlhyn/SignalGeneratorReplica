# Signal Generator
This application is an interactive audio signal generator and visualizer using JUCE. It allows users to generate different types of waveforms (sine waves and pulse trains) and apply audio filters (low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass), and visualize the resulting waveforms in real-time.
